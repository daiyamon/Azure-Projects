Managing Azure Subscriptions and Implementing RBAC: A Hands-On Lab

Lab Scenario:

In this lab, we will focus on managing Azure subscriptions and implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure efficient resource management and security within our Azure environment.

    Creating a Management Group:
        We will start by creating a management group that includes all our Azure subscriptions. Management groups provide a way to efficiently handle access control, policies, and compliance across multiple subscriptions.

    Granting Permissions:
        Next, we will grant permissions to submit support requests for all subscriptions within the management group. These permissions will be limited to specific actions, including creating and managing virtual machines, as well as creating support request tickets. It's crucial to ensure that these permissions are scoped appropriately to maintain security and compliance.

Job Skills:

In this lab, we will cover the following tasks:

    Implement Management Groups (Task 1):
        Learn how to create and configure management groups to organize and manage Azure resources effectively.

    Review and Assign a Built-in Azure Role (Task 2):
        Explore built-in Azure roles and understand their permissions and scope. Assign a suitable built-in role to the management group to grant necessary permissions.

    Create a Custom RBAC Role (Task 3):
        Dive deeper into RBAC by creating a custom role tailored to our specific requirements. Define the permissions needed for managing virtual machines and submitting support requests.

    Monitor Role Assignments with the Activity Log (Task 4):
        Utilize Azure Activity Log to monitor role assignments and track changes made to access permissions. This helps maintain visibility and auditability of access control changes.
